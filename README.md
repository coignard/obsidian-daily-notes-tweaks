# Daily Notes Tweaks for Obsidian

This plugin provides a command to open a random daily note and has an option to automatically switch past daily notes to reading mode.

## Features

-   **Open Random Daily Note**: Adds a command to open a random daily note from your vault. This is useful for reviewing past entries or rediscovering old ideas.

## How to Use

For convenience, you can assign a hotkey to this command in Obsidian's «Hotkeys» settings.

### Settings
